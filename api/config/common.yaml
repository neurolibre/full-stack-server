# ── MyST Build Resources ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# These control how myst-libre runs notebook execution containers and
# the mystmd build process. See docs/build-process-architecture.md in
# the myst-libre repo for the full picture.

# Container resource limits for the JupyterHub notebook execution container.
# null  = unlimited (Docker default)
# "max" = auto-detect system resources, reserve some for the host
# Or set explicit values: cpu_limit: 4, memory_limit: "8g"
CONTAINER_CPU_LIMIT: "max"
CONTAINER_MEMORY_LIMIT: "max"

# Maximum number of notebooks mystmd will execute in parallel inside a
# single build.  mystmd default is (CPU_count - 1) which is aggressive
# when multiple builds run concurrently.
# Set to a low number (1-3) to avoid overloading the server.
MYST_EXECUTE_PARALLEL: 2

# Maximum time (seconds) for the entire `myst build` process.
# Covers notebook execution + HTML build + theme server.
# If exceeded, the process tree is killed and the build fails.
# null = no timeout (relies on Celery's soft_time_limit instead)
MYST_BUILD_TIMEOUT: 3600
